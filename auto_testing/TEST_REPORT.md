# AGV Control System Test Report

## Test Environment
- **API Endpoint**: `http://10.6.68.65:8080/agvo/rest`
- **Python Version**: 3.8+
- **Dependencies**: `requests`, `urllib3`


## Limitations

### Current Constraints
1. **Static Vertex Mapping**
   - Hardcoded vertex IDs (W1=4, W2=5, S1=28)
   - ✖️ Breaks if warehouse layout changes
   - ✖️ Cannot adapt to new shelves/vertices

2. **Simulated Inventory**
   - Uses mock inventory data
   - ✖️ No live stock level integration

3. **Task Tracking**
   - API response doesn't return task IDs
   - ✖️ Limits progress monitoring

## Roadmap

### Immediate Next Steps
**In Development**:
- Dynamic Vertex Configuration
  - Fetch IDs from API/configuration files
  - Auto-discover new warehouse vertices
